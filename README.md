1. #### A patient with severe pulmonary fibrosis wishes to travel on an airplane. What amount of supplemental oxygen will be needed to  maintain the arterial oxygen concentration at about 70 mm Hg? Assume the airplane cabin is pressurized at 580 mm Hg and that the patient’s alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient is 150 mm Hg.?
    1. 40%
    2. 50%
    3. 60%
    4. 70%
    5. 80%

    Answer -> 

2. #### A clinician wishes to perform a single-breath induction with sevoflu rane and exceed the maximum sevoflurane concentration supplied by the vaporizer. She fills a 3-L reservoir bag with oxygen and adds 2 mL of sevoflurane liquid to the bag. What will the  concentration of sevoflurane vapor be in the reservoir bag? Assume the operating room is at sea level and the room temperature is 20°C. The ideal gas constant is 0.082 L-atm-°K-1-mole-1, the specific gravity of sevoflurane is 1.52, and its molecular weight is 200 g/ mol.

    2. 13.5%
    3. 14.8%
    4. 16.1%
    5. 18.5%

3. #### In the typical operating room, patients lose heat via all of the following mechanisms EXCEPT
    1. sublimation
    2. conduction
    3. convection
    4. radiation
    5. evaporation

    Answer -> 

4. #### An anesthesiologist plans a clinical study comparing a new antiemetic with ondansetron. 100 women undergoing elective aparoscopic tubal ligation will be randomized to receive either the new antiemetic or a standard 4-mg- dose of ondansetron. The primary outcome variable is the number of women that vomit postoperatively in each group. In all likelihood, the best statistical test to compare the two treatments will be
    1. Student’s t-test for unpaired data
    2. Student’s t-test for paired data
    3. analysis of variance
    4. chi squared
    5. Wilcoxon rank-sum test

    Answer -> 

### Questions 5-7:

 #### The standard extension cord used in a particular hospital is 15 feet long and has a capacitance of 0.05 μF. The capacitive reactance of each extension cord when used with 60 Hz power is 53 kilohms. Three of these extension cords are plugged into a circuit protected by the same circuit breaker and line isolation monitor. Assume that the three extension cords are the only sources of capacitance and capacitive reactance on the circuit.
    
5. ##### What is the value of the capacitance in the circuit?
    1. 0.0167 μF
    2. 0.025 μF
    3. 0.05 μF
    4. 0.10 μF
    5. 0.15 μF
