1. #### A patient with severe pulmonary fibrosis wishes to travel on an airplane. What amount of supplemental oxygen will be needed to  maintain the arterial oxygen concentration at about 70 mm Hg? Assume the airplane cabin is pressurized at 580 mm Hg and that the patient’s alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient is 150 mm Hg.?
    1. 40%
    2. 50%
    3. 60%
    4. 70%
    5. 80%

    Answer ->(2 option)  50%   
***Explanation*** :: The patient’s alveolar oxygen concentration is estimated from the alveolar gas equation:
    ![ScreenShot](images/q-1.png)  
* Assuming a value of 0.8 for the respiratory quotient, the patient’s alveolar oxygen concentration would be approximately 222 mm
    Hg when breathing 50% oxygen. The patient’s arterial oxygen concentration would therefore be approximately 72 mm Hg.
